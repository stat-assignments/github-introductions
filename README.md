# github-introductions
Introduce yourself to github

## 📝 Todo Items

-   Clone this repository to your local machine
-   On your local machine, create a new markdown file in this repository named 'About_Me.md'. Provide a short biography/introduction for yourself and use markdown formatting
    - [Markdown Basics](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html) provides an overview of different formatting options in markdown.
    - You must use at least the following formatting elements: header, subheader, bold or italic, bulleted list, and an image.
-   Commit your changes to your new file locally and push them back to your github repository. Check on Github to make sure the new file appears.
-   To get full credit for your assignment, you will need to have worked with your git repository locally. I will be able to see if you have used the github editor to make your changes instead :).
